Данные для обучения моделей необходимо загрузить самостоятельно с сайта. Целевая переменная – наличие болезни сердца (HeartDisease). Она принимает значения 0 или 1 в зависимости от отсутствия или наличия болезни соответственно. Подробное описание признаков можно прочесть в описании датасета на сайте. Для выполнения работы не обязательно вникать в медицинские показатели.\n","\n","Этапы работы:\n","\n","    Получите данные и загрузите их в рабочую среду. (Jupyter Notebook или другую)\n","\n","    Подготовьте датасет к обучению моделей:\n","\n","    a) Категориальные переменные переведите в цифровые значения. Можно использовать pd.get_dummies, preprocessing.LabelEncoder. Старайтесь не использовать для этой задачи циклы.\n","\n","    Разделите выборку на обучающее и тестовое подмножество. 80% данных оставить на обучающее множество, 20% на тестовое.\n","\n","    Обучите модель логистической регрессии с параметрами по умолчанию.\n","    Подсчитайте основные метрики модели. Используйте следующие метрики и функцию:\n","\n","    cross_validate(…, cv=10, scoring=['accuracy','recall','precision','f1'])\n","\n","    Оптимизируйте 3-4 параметра модели:\n","\n","    a) Используйте GridSearchCV.\n","\n","    b) Используйте RandomizedSearchCV.\n","\n","    c) *Добавьте в п. 6b 2-5 моделей классификации и вариации их параметров.\n","\n","    d) Повторите п. 5 после каждого итогового изменения параметров.\n","\n","    Сформулируйте выводы по проделанной работе:\n","\n","    a) Сравните метрики построенных моделей.\n","\n","    b) *Сравните с полученными результатами в домашнем задании по теме \n","    \n","
